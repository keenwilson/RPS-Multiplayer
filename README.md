# RPS-Multiplayer

## How this app works

* Created an online _two-player Rock-Paper-Scissors_ game with the help of _Firebase_ to store and sync data between users and devices in realtime using **a cloud-hosted, NoSQL database**. 
* Utilized _JavaScript_ to build game logic and display results.
* Use _Bulma_ CSS framework to make development lifecycle faster and easier. 
* This app comes with chat functionality that users can send texts and see if the opponent has disconnected.

### User Story
* Only two users can play at the same time.
* Both players pick either rock, paper or scissors. After the players make their selection, the game will tell them whether a tie occurred or if one player defeated the other.
* The game will track each player's wins and losses.
