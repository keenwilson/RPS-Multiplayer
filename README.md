# RPS-Multiplayer

## How this app works

* Created an online _two-player Rock-Paper-Scissors_ game with the help of _Firebase_ to store and sync data between users and devices in realtime using **a cloud-hosted, NoSQL database**. 
* Utilized _JavaScript_ to build game logic and display results.
* Use _Bulma_ CSS framework to make development lifecycle faster and easier. 
* This app comes with chat functionality that users can send texts and see if the opponent has disconnected.
